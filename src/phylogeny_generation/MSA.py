class MSA:
    r"""
    An MSA contains a multiple sequence alignment of proteins.

    The MSA is read from the MSA file f'{a3m_dir}/{protein_family_name}.a3m'.
    *Lowercase amino acids in the MSA file are ignored.*
    After ignoring all lowercase letters, all sequences in the MSA should have
    the same length. The main purpose of this class is to enable reading and
    preprocessing of MSA files. By preprocessing we specifically mean removing all
    lowercase letters from the alignment. The preprocessed MSA can be written out
    to a file with the write_to_file method. The MSA can be obtained as a dictionary
    mapping protein name to sequence with the get_msa method. The number of sequences
    and sites after preprocessing can be obtained via the nseqs and nsites attributes.
    To get the sequence of a specific protein, one can use the get_sequence method.

    Args:
        a3m_dir: Directory where the MSA file (.a3m) is found.
        protein_family_name: Name of the protein family.
        max_seqs: If nonzero, this number of sequences in the MSA file will be subsampled
            uniformly at random. The first sequence in the MSA file will always be sampled.
        max_sites: If nonzero, this number of sites in the MSA file will be subsampled
            uniformly at random.

    Attributes:
        nseqs: Number of sequences in the MSA (after subsamping)
        nsites: Number of sites in the MSA (after subsampling)
