    r"""
    Generate frequency matrices from a transition file.

    The hyperparameters are passed in '__init__', and the frequency matrices are only
    computed upon call to the 'run' method.

    Args:
        a3m_dir_full: Directory with MSAs for ALL protein families. Used
            to determine which max_families will get subsampled.
        a3m_dir: Directory where the MSA files (.a3m) are found. Although they
            are never read, this must be provided to be able to subsample families via the 'max_families' argument.
        transitions_dir: Directory where the transition files (.transitions) are found.
        n_process: Number of processes used to parallelize computation.
        expected_number_of_MSAs: The number of files in a3m_dir. This argument
            is only used to sanity check that the correct a3m_dir is being used.
            It has no functional implications.
        outdir: Directory where the generated frequency matrices will be found (matrices.txt file)
        max_families: Only run on 'max_families' randomly chosen files in a3m_dir.
            This is useful for testing and to see what happens if less data is used.
        num_sites: Whether the transitions are for single sites (num_sites=1) or for pairs
            of sites (num_sites=2).
        center: Quantization grid center
        step_size: Quantization grid step size (geometric)
        n_steps: Number of grid points left and right of center (for a total
            of 2 * n_steps + 1 grid points)
        keep_outliers: What to do with points that are outside the grid. If
            False, they will be dropped. If True, they will be assigned
            to the corresponding closest endpoint of the grid.
        max_height: Use only transitions whose starting node is at height
            at most max_height from the leaves in its subtree. This is
            used to filter out unreliable maximum parsimony transitions.
        max_path_height: Use only transitions whose starting node is at height
            at most max_path_height from the leaves in its subtree, in terms
            of the NUMBER OF EDGES. This is used to filter out unreliable
            maximum parsimony transitions.
        edge_or_cherry: If "edge", edge transitions will be used. If "cherry",
            cherry transitions will be used instead. Note that "cherry"
            transitions do not depend on the maximum parsimony reconstruction!
        use_cached: If True and the output file already exists for a family,
            all computation will be skipped for that family.
